@Controller and @RestController
Difference between annotation:

controller - work for both / response directly to the body @ResponseBody
restController - use the ResponseBody by default, so we don need to duplicate the same code for all methods

    right annotation for restController: @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping
